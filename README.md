AppGrid is a simple, native macOS launcher that displays all installed applications in a clean, full-screen grid.

It was built as a lightweight replacement for Launchpad, using SwiftUI, with no subscriptions, no tracking, and no unnecessary features.

## Installation

To use AppGrid, you can either download it manually or install it via Homebrew.

### Option 1: Manual installation

Download AppGrid from the **Releases** page, unzip the app, and drag it into your Applications folder.

### Option 2: Homebrew (recommended)

If you use Homebrew, you can install AppGrid with:

```sh
brew tap naluisgod/appgrid
brew install --cask appgrid

--
